    <p>I really like the way it makes you scroll down through the page and the pictures warp a little as you scroll. It's a pretty simple design and easy to navigate through the tabs at the top. I really like the "about us" section and the triangle design that moves as you scroll. It's really different from other websites I've seen. </p>
